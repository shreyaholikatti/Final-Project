          <p>Hi! I'm Ishani Singh, a rising senior at Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, California. I've been an Indian Classical Dancer since I was 5 years old. I also fell in love writing when I was around 11 and started publishing short stories online. Since, I’ve become a staff writer at my school’s hybrid news magazine, El Estoque, and an intern at the Stanford Daily News. I’ve recently gotten into CS through Girls Who Code and have really been enjoying it! I hope to pursue Computer Science in my further studies and establish a career in the field!</p>

          <p> Hello! I'm Shreya Holikatti, a rising junior at Granite Bay High School in Granite Bay, California. I've been playing piano since I was 7 years old and have been a part of the Certificate of Merit program for the last 5 years while also dedicating the last 10 years to become a black belt in mixed martial arts. I am also part of a non-proft-Cognitive Exchange- which teaches underprivileged students in other countries basic speech and debate skills. Through Girls Who Code, I have been able to explore CS, which I hope to pursue in the future! </p>
